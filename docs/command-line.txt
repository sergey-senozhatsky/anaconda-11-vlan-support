askmethod       Do not automatically use the CD-ROM as the install
		source if we detect a Red Hat Linux CD in your CD-ROM drive.

		device ordering on SCSI systems.

noparport       Do not attempt to load support for parallel ports

                to the machine using a vnc client application.

vncpassword=<password>  Enable a password for the vnc connection. This will
                prevent someone from inadvertantly connecting to the
                vnc-based installation.

                Requires 'vnc' option to be specified as well.

vncconnect=<host>[:<port>]   Once installation is up and running, connect to
                the vnc client named <host>, and optionally use port <port>.

                Requires 'vnc' option to be specified as well.

updates         Prompt for floppy containing updates (bug fixes).

updates=ftp://<path> Image containing updates over FTP.

dd              Use a driver disk.

driverdisk      Same as 'dd'.

mediacheck	Activates loader code to give user option of testing integrity
		of install source (if an ISO-based method).

rescue          Run rescue environment.

nomount         Don't automatically mount any installed Linux partitions 
                in rescue mode.

nopass          Don't pass keyboard/mouse info to stage 2 installer, good for
                testing keyboard and mouse config screens in stage2 installer
                during network installs.


serial          Turns on serial console support.

ksdevice        Takes one of 4 types of argument which tells install
                what network device to use for kickstart from network:

		- An argument like 'eth0' naming a specific interface
		- An argument like 00:12:34:56:78:9a indicating the
		  MAC address of a specific interface
		- The keyword `link' indicating that the first
		  interface with link up
		- The keyword `bootif' indicating that the MAC address
		  indicated by the BOOTIF command line option will be
		  used to locate the boot interface. BOOTIF is
		  automagically supplied by pxelinux when you include
		  the option `IPAPPEND 2' in your pxelinux.cfg file

ks              Kickstart over NFS.

ks=cdrom:       Kickstart from CDROM

ks=nfs(:options):<path>   Kickstart from NFS.  NFS mount options are optional.

kssendmac	Adds HTTP headers to ks=http:// request that can be helpful
                for provisioning systems.  Includes MAC address of all
		nics in CGI environment variables of the form:
                "X-RHN-Provisioning-MAC-0: eth0 01:23:45:67:89:ab".

dhcpclass=<class> Sends a custom DHCP vendor class identifier. ISC's dhcpcd can

upgradeany	Don't require an /etc/redhat-release that matches the 
		expected syntax to upgrade.

lang=<lang>	Language to use for the installation.  This should be a

method=hd://<dev>/<path> Use <path> on <dev> for a hard drive installation

method=cdrom     Do a CDROM based installation.

vnc             Do graphical installation via VNC.  Instead of
                starting a normal X server, vncserver will be started
                and you can then connect remotely to do the
                installation.

vncpassword=<password>  Set a password for the vnc session.

vncconnect=<host>[:<port>]   Once installation is up and running, connect to
                the vnc client named <host>, and optionally, on port <port>.
