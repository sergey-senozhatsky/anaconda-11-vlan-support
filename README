Problem of missing VLAN support for anaconda stage1 installer has been
around for quite some time already.

Anaconda mailing list (Aug 2010) proposes the following solution

"I ask our network guys to assign a default VLAN to switch ports.
I don't know the correct networking terminology, so I will describe 
the process

Server boots to perform kickstart
sends DHCP query (no VLAN tag)
Switch notices untagged packets and assigns them to "default" VLAN

I use this "default" VLAN specifically for building servers, and use 
it across multiple target networks.
Final network configuration (derived from kickstart template) can be 
whatever you want (e.g. include VLAN tag info for other networks)"

In RH's bugzilla VLAN support present since 2010-08-17 and marked 
as FutureFeature/Enhancement Request: "add VLAN tagging to anaconda"
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=624752

This repository contains my own solution (patch) for the problem in question, 
which worked in our environment, though never been tested elsewhere.



=========================================================================
VLAN support patch
In order to enable VLAN tagging, please apply
 anaconda-11-vlanid-v1.patch


=========================================================================
USAGE EXAMPLE

VLAN could be specified in several ways, for example, as a boot parameter

	 linux ip=10.6.27.XX gateway=10.6.0.0 netmask=255.255.192.0 
	 dns=10.6.27.XX vlanid=44 ks=http://10.6.27.XX/iso/anaconda-ks.cfg

or via VLAN field in a stage1 UI.


=========================================================================
FIXES

While working on this I've also fixed several anaconda bugs

(some of them are)
- endless loop on doDhcp error in configureTCPIP;
- endless loop in kickstartNetworkUp;
- workaround for "pumpSetupInterface error: Operation not permitted" with 
  the gateway parameter specified.


=========================================================================
NOTE

PLEASE NOTE, since I don't have any hardware for testing anymore, it's
quite possible that I will not be able to provide any assistance or help 
in case of any problems on your side.


The code doesn't follow anaconda's original codestyles (whitespaces,
javaLikeFunctionNames, etc.), so it hasn't been pushed to RH/anaconda team.


Only source code and patch are provided, no spec files or any 3-rd party
patches (CentOS, Fedora, RH, etc.) attached. Please apply them on your own.
